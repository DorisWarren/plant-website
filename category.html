        <h1>Indoor Plant Care</h1>
        <h4>Foliage</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The first thing to consider when selecting a houseplant is where you want to put it. Then match the space and lighting with the plant’s requirements. Do you have a big spot by a sunny window or a small space with moderate light?
        <br>
        Next ask yourself if you are looking for a plant with beautiful green leaves or would prefer a flowering plant. Some flowering houseplants are seasonal while others will bloom year after year.
        <br>
        A third consideration is how much time you can devote to a particular plant. A spider plant will take almost any amount of care (or neglect), while an orchid requires significant tender, loving care.</p>

            <h4>Watering | Things to look out for</h4>
            <br>
            Potting soil should be kept moist, but not wet. Of course, there are always exceptions — succulents, and other thick-leafed plants do best when the soil dries out between watering. If the soil is kept too dry or too damp the plant’s roots will begin to die, which can lead to inadequate growth or even death of the plant.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Dehydration</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> let plants get to the point where they are wilting or the soil is pulling away from the edge of the container. These symptoms indicate dehydration and at this point the plant is already seriously stressed and the roots may be damaged.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>Signs of underwatering include:</strong>
            <li>Slow Leaf growth</li>
            <li>Translucent leaves</li>
            <li>Premature dropping of flowers or leaves</li>
            <li>Brown, Yellow or curled leaf edges</li>
            <br>
            <h4>Overwatering</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Too much water is just as detrimental as too little. Frequent watering forces air from the soil and opens the door for root-killing bacteria and fungus to move in. Overwatering is the number one killer of houseplants</p>
            <br>
            <strong>Signs of overwatering include:</strong>
            <li>Fungus or mold on the soil surface</li>
            <li>Mushy brown (maybe stinky) roots at the bottom of the pot</li>
            <li>Standing water in the bottom of the container</li>
            <li>Young and old leaves falling off at the same time</li>
            <li>Leaves with brown rotten patches</li>
            <br>
            <h4>Wondering what is the proper way to water?</h4>
            <br>
            <strong>Water Quality</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Room temperature tap water should be fine for most indoor plants, even if there is chlorine or fluoride added to your city’s water. Plants especially love rainwater or melted snow (unless you live in a region with acid rain). Avoid continuous use of softened water, which may contain sodium.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>How to Water</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Plants can be watered from the top down or bottom up. When watering from the top, try not to wet the foliage, while ensuring the entire soil mass is moistened. Water should be coming out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.
            <br>
            If you prefer to let your plants do the work, set the plant in a dish of water and the roots (and capillary action in the soil) will pull up whatever they need. This method, known as bottom-watering, is a more thorough, if time-consuming, way to water plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong>Be sure to dump any standing water from the saucer one hour after watering!</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Drainage</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Good drainage is essential to healthy houseplants. Start with a good, organic potting soil (not regular soil) that has been mixed specifically for indoor gardening.
            <br>
            Choose a container with drainage holes, or put a layer of pebbles in the bottom of a container without holes. The point is to not let the plant stand in water. From time to time, check that the drainage holes have not been clogged. And always empty standing water (don’t run it back through the plant’s soil).</p>

            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <br>
            As with watering, every plant has different light requirements. Many plants prefer direct sunlight, but this may be hard to get inside a house. Placing a plant in a window might offer enough light, but some houseplants will need supplementing from a grow light.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Where should I place my houseplants?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>A dimly lit room should suffice for those few plants willing to survive in low light areas. Moderate light-needing plants will prefer a north-facing window, light diffused through a thin curtain or daylight without direct sun. Indoor plants that prefer high light will need to be in a south-facing window or under a grow light.
            <br>
            South-facing windows provide the brightest conditions for the longest amount of time, making them most suitable for plants that need bright and direct sunlight. In winter, any plant will benefit from a position near a southern window, but low-light loving plants may get sunburned by the bright light in late spring, summer or early fall.
            <br>
            East and west windows, on the other hand, suit many plants in the medium light range. Only plants requiring low light levels or no direct sunlight should be placed by north-facing windows.
            <br>
            North facing windows. These windows tend to have the weakest light intensity and are often in relatively deep shade throughout the window. It may be possible to grow shade-loving plants in a north-facing window during the summer months, but in the winter, these windows are usually not conducive to plant growth.
            <br>
            How close to a window you place your plant also matters. While distance varies, It is recommend putting a plant 3 to 10 feet away from a windowsill.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What other factors might affect the amount of light my house plant gets?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Some decorating choices you make may also affect how much sunlight your houseplants receive. Light-colored or reflective surfaces on the walls and floor will increase the intensity of light available to your plants, while darker surfaces decrease light intensity.
            <br>
            If you want to add a sun-loving Bird of Paradise in your living room, consider painting your room a lighter color or hanging a mirror opposite a window to up the light intensity. For plants that flourish in low light, consider a darker shade for your walls or investing in some thick curtains to block light.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Foliage Plants</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Foliage plants can be divided into three categories: those requiring low light, moderate light and high light.
            <br>
            Inadequate light can cause plants to have spindly stems, yellow foliage and leaf drop, while too much can lead to leaf burn or pale foliage. One of the best ways to avoid these outcomes is to consider the natural flow of sunlight coming through your windows.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Temperature</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Almost all house plants come from tropical and subtropical climates with temperatures very much like those in our homes. A daytime temperature range of anywhere from 65° to 75°F (18° to 24°C) is just perfect for them, and most plants have no trouble tolerating occasional summertime highs of up to 90°F (32°C).
            <br>
            Generally speaking, indoor temperatures that you find acceptable will also be just fine for healthy growth of your house plants.
            <br>
            Even tropical plants like cooler air at night than during the day. As a result, healthier growth will be seen if temperatures drop 5° to 10°F (3° to 5°C) at night. Night temperatures naturally drop indoors, especially near windows.
            <br>
            Such cooler night temperatures are not only good for house plants and humans, they also help conserve energy.
            <br>
            Long periods of extreme heat can be harmful to house plants. You can increase ventilation through screened windows or a fan. Air conditioning will also help bring temperatures down to acceptable levels, but house plants should not be put directly in the path of cold drafts. Since humidity is removed from the air through air conditioning, some means of increasing humidity may be necessary, especially in dry climates.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Humidity</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Most plants thrive in high humidity — around 80%. Unfortunately, most homes are much drier, especially in the winter when forced heat can even further drop the humidity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using a humidifier can help, but there are other ways to increase the moisture in the air near your plants. A small tray containing pebbles and water can boost local humidity as can grouping plants more closely together. Daily misting of the plant’s leaves can help as well. For some plants, such as gardenias and orchids, keeping them in a bathroom or the kitchen (both usually have a higher humidity) can help.</p>

            <h4>Fertilizing House Plants</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Never try to equate fertilizing with feeding. Plants get their energy from light, not fertilizers. Unless good light levels are supplied and the plant is growing well, fertilizing will do more harm than good. Newly purchased or repotted house plants should be given a few months rest from feeding so that they can use up the nutrients already present in their growing mix.
            <br>
            Every time a plant is watered nutrients leach out of the soil. Even if that didn’t happen, plants would quickly deplete the nutrients in their soil. Unlike plants living outside, houseplants don’t have a regular source of nutrient replenishment unless you fertilize them regularly. (Newly purchased plants have been heavily fertilized in the greenhouse and can wait a few weeks before getting started on a fertilizing regime.)
            <br>
            Fertilize once a month when plants are flowering or growing. During the winter, when plants are dormant or generally not growing much, fertilizer can be withheld.
            <br>
            If a plant is dropping its lower leaves, showing weak growth or an overall yellow-green color, it may need more fertilizer. It might also need more light or less water, so take the time to analyze all conditions before pouring on more plant food. Adding fertilizer when a plant does not need it can be worse than doing nothing at all.
            <br>
            <h4>Constant Feed Method</h4>
            <br>
            One way to make sure your house plants get the fertilizer they need is to use a constant feed method.
            <br>
            Simply take a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer designed for a monthly application and reduce its dosage by four. For example, if the label states it should be applied once a month at a rate of one teaspoon per gallon, apply it at every watering at a rate of ¼ teaspoon per gallon. Once a month, take the plant to the sink and leach it carefully by running clear water through its pot until the excess fertilizer runs into the drain. This helps prevent buildup.
            <br>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If a plant is wilted, water well first then apply a fertalizer later - after it has recovered.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Inprganic Vs. Organic Fertalizers</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Both organic and inorganic fertilizers provide plants with the nutrients needed to grow healthy and strong. However, each contains different ingredients and supplies these nutrients in different ways. Organic fertilizers work over time to create a healthy growing environment, while inorganic fertilizers provide rapid nutrition. Determining which is better for your plants depends largely on the needs of your plants and your preferences in terms of cost and environmental impact.Fertilizers supplement the soil with macronutrients needed in large amounts: nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. However, organic and inorganic fertilizers do so via different materials. Organic fertilizers contain only plant- or animal-based materials that are either a byproduct or end product of naturally occurring processes, such as manures, leaves, and compost.
            <br>
            <h6>Composition</h6>
            <br>
            Inorganic fertilizer, also referred to as synthetic fertilizer, is manufactured artificially and contains minerals or synthetic chemicals. For example, synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are typically made from petroleum or natural gas. Phosphorus, potassium and other trace elements in inorganic fertilizers are often mined from the earth. Balanced inorganic fertilizers, high in all three macronutrients, commonly include products like ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, potassium chloride (potash), triple superphosphate, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts).
            <br>
            <h6>Nutrient Availability</h6>
            <br>
            Organic fertilizers release nutrients only when the soil is warm and moist, which tends to correspond with your plants’ times of greatest need. However, they rely on soil organisms to break down organic matter, so nutrients are released more slowly than they are from inorganic fertilizers. This slow-release method reduces the risk of nutrient leaching, but it takes time to supply nutrients to plants. In contrast, inorganic fertilizers provide this nutrition in plant-ready form immediately. However, the concentration of nutrients increases the risk of burning the plant, and the rapid release of nutrients may leach them deeply into the soil and water table where plants can't access them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Major Elements for healthy growth</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Plants require three major elements for healthy growth: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These are always listed on fertilizer labels in the form of ratios: 6-12-4, for example, indicates 6 percent nitrogen, 12 percent phosphorus, and 4 percent potassium. Most fertilizers also contain some of the minor elements -- magnesium, boron, iron, etc. -- that plants also need for growth.
            <br>
            Generally speaking, fertilizers rich in nitrogen (the first number) will stimulate healthy, green growth of foliage, while those rich in phosphorus (the second number) will encourage good root development and improved flowering. Those rich in potassium (the third number) will help build up reserves for plants that have a dormant period.
            <br>
            A fertilizer labeled 30-20-20 would be good for leaf development and would be most recommended for foliage house plants, while flowering house plants would prefer one richer in phosphorus, such as 15-30-15. Most foliage house plants get along fine with an all-purpose or high-nitrogen fertilizer, while one with a high proportion of phosphorus is best for flowering house plants.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Potting House Plants</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Repot house plants at least once a year, preferably in the spring. Fast-growing house plants may require repotting two or more times a year.
            <br>
            One sign that a house plant needs repotting is when it begins to wilt only a few days after a thorough watering. House plants should also be repotted when they threaten to tip over (put these into clay pots or use a heavy potting mix). When a white or yellowish crust begins to build up on the plant’s stem and pot rim, indicating an excess of mineral salts, it is also time to repot.
            <br>
            House plants that are difficult or impossible to repot -- a tree-sized plant, for example -- should be top-dressed annually. This simply means scraping off the top inch of potting mix and replacing it with new mix. This procedure will help remove any toxic mineral salts that have built up.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>How to Repot</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Tip the plant upside down, holding its stem and rootball firmly. If it does not slide out on its own, run a knife around the inside of the pot to loosen the rootball. With a pencil or your finger, remove up to one third of the original potting mixture from all around the rootball, gently teasing it loose. Trim off any dead or damaged roots. For repotting, choose a clean pot no more than one or two sizes larger than the previous one. If the plant has reached its full size, don’t increase the pot size. Pour enough potting mix into the bottom of the new pot to bring the plant up to its original height. Center it well and fill in the empty space with growing mix. A thorough watering will help the plant adjust to its new home.
            <br>
            Newly repotted house plants should be kept out of bright sun for a week or two.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Potting Mixes for House Plants</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Most house plants thrive in ready-made all-purpose potting mixes. Most modern mixes are soilless, made of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite in various proportions. They are light and well aerated, yet hold moisture well, making them ideal for plant growth.
            <br>
            Asparagus ferns, caladiums, Boston ferns, and many other plants prefer this potting mix. Soil-based mixes are heavier and drain more rapidly. They make good choices for cacti and succulents.
            <br>
            Finally, certain indoor plants, such as cattleya orchids and Venus’s fly-traps, normally grow on trees in the wild and require very well-aerated mixes. They are often grown in fast-draining mixes such as sphagnum moss, bark chips, or special epiphyte mixes.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Improving Your Potting Soil</h4>
            <br>
            <h6>Take these steps to ensure your plants have the soil they need:</h6>
            <br>
            <li>Repot every year. This is probably the easiest and most practical of all options. The fact is, the vast majority of people grow in peat-based bagged soils, and that's probably not going to change anytime soon. But for the sake of your plants, repot every year and you'll have healthier, more productive plants.</li>
            <li>Improve your bagged soil. It's not a long-term fix, but you can improve on peat-based growing mixes by mixing in a few handfuls of perlite. It won't slow the decomposition rate of the peat, but it will increase aeration.</li>
            <li>Flush the soil thoroughly every month, at a minimum. Take the plant to the kitchen sink or outside and thoroughly flush the soil to wash out accumulated salts from fertilizer and deposits from tap water.</li>
            <br>

              <h4>What are succulents?</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Succulent plants, or succulents, are a collection of plants that have water storage tissues.  Succulent plants are drought resistant plants. They have adapted to survive very dry, arid conditions. These plants typically store water in their leaves, their stems, or their roots.
              <br>
              The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning juice or sap. Their leaves tend to be fleshy, plump and thick to conserve water and to help minimize water loss.
              <h4>Are Cacti Succulents?</h4>
              <br>
              Cacti and succulents are sometimes grouped together and sometimes separately, which can lead to some confusion. A cactus or cacti are a unique subset of the succulent group. The cactus family, or Cactaceae, is one of the largest families of succulents in the world. The word cactus is derived from the Greek word kaktos, meaning spiny plant. Cacti are fleshy plants that store water, making them part of the succulent group. This group of plants are remarkable for their fleshy stems which serve to store water, prickly or hairy coating, and very few, or rarely any leaves. Due to these unique characteristics, you can almost easily identify a cactus just by their appearance. Generally speaking, all cacti are considered succulents but not all succulents are considered cacti. However, definitions and terminologies may vary depending on where you get your source of information. Horticulturists regularly excludes cacti from the succulent group.  But for the majority of us succulent lovers or those who grow succulents as a hobby, these differences in definitions and classifications are not of major significance.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h4>Where are they from?</h4>
              <br>
              Succulents are found all over the world in their natural habitats. They have a wide and rich range of habitats and are often found in environments that would otherwise be uninhabited. Most come from dry areas, deserts and semi-deserts ranging from Africa to North and South America; still others are found in mountainous regions and rain forests. Conditions that are normally too harsh for other plants to survive, such as high temperatures and low precipitation have made these plants extremely hardy and adaptable. Some succulents are also naturally found in sea coasts and dry lakes, which can be detrimental to other plant species because of their extreme levels of dissolved minerals.

              <h4><strong>Watering Cacti and Succulants</strong></h4>
              <br>
              <p>Watering is one of the most important aspects of succulent care. Knowing when and how to water your succulents are keys to their survival. Overwatering is one of the easiest ways to accidentally kill your succulents due to their susceptibility to root rot, which is caused by damp roots. It is also dangerous to leave the plant completely dry for long periods of time, as the roots will start to die back.
              <br>
              <h4>How often do you need to water Indoor Succulants?</h4>
              <br>
              One of the most dangerous things for your indoor succulents is watering them incorrectly. Succulents hold moisture in their leaves, stems and tissues. They use these stored water to survive in dry conditions. Too much water is deadly to these plants. But they still need to be watered in order to survive and thrive. Leaving them too dry for too long can also cause their roots to die. The best way to determine when to water is to examine the soil and feel for moisture. Do not just touch the surface of the soil, but the top inch of the soil needs to be dry to the touch before you water your plant.
              <br>
              <br>
              How much and when you water also depends on the season. During the growing season, usually from spring to fall when growth is most active, water the plants thoroughly until some of the water begins to drain out of the holes of the pot (this may not happen with all potted pots). Sometimes, the water does not drain out of the pot but as long as you gave it a good drink of water, it should be fine. Make sure not to let the water collect in saucers. Pour out those excess water that collected in saucers. Allowing the water to drain out is good for the plants as it helps prevent root rot and it also prevents dissolved salts from accumulating in the soil. For most indoor potted plants, watering about once every ten to fourteen days during the active growing season should be sufficient.
              <br>
              <br>
              During the inactive season (usually in winter time for most succulents), when the plant is dormant, water less frequently and less thoroughly. Check the soil for moisture and water only when the plant is dry to the touch but not completely bone-dry. Water only to moisten but not soak the plant. During the inactive months, the general rule is to water about once every three to four weeks. Pay attention to how your plants look. If they start looking shriveled between waterings, you may need to water them more often. If unsure in the beginning, water the plants lightly. It is better to under water than to over water until you figure out the ideal watering needs of your plants.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h4>Watering Succulants in pots and containers without drainage holes</h4>
              <br>
              Some people advise against using containers without drainage holes for succulents. The reason being is that succulents do not like to sit in water. Having drainage holes allows excess water to drain out of the pots preventing root rot. You might be tempted to use a container without drainage holes because you like how it looks or you need to use it for a particular project. Whatever the reason, a container without any drainage holes is possible to use, but watering will be extra tricky because there is more possibility of overwatering and drowning your plants.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you have containers without drainage holes in them, you need to pay extra care and attention when watering your succulents. Allow plants to dry out in between waterings and feel the soil for moisture. The top inch of the soil needs to feel dry to the touch before you water. Remember that excess water cannot drain out of the holes so go easy on watering. Using a syringe,  a spray bottle, or squeeze bottle will help control the amount of water you put into the containers. When using a spray bottle, make sure to spray the soil or medium instead of just the top of the plant. You want the water to get to the roots where it is absorbed by the plant and not just mist the plant from the surface. Watering frequency also depends on the growing season and size of your container. During the dry season or growing season, plants need more water. During the inactive growing season or when it’s cooler, water less frequently. The size of your container also determines how often and how much to water. Smaller containers hold less moisture than larger containers.
              <br>
              <br>
              If unsure in the beginning, water the plants lightly and adjust as needed. It is better to under water than to over water until you get the hang of watering your plants in containers without drainage holes. If you accidentally pour too much water, you can get rid of the excess moisture by using a dry towel to dab the water. You can also pour excess water out carefully. Watering should be monitored closely when using these types of pots.

              <h4>How to Avoid Overwatering and Underwatering your succulants</h4>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Underwatering Succulants</strong> </h5>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Shriveling or puckering of leaves</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Succulents are known for their plump and fleshy leaves. The plant will start to shrivel and pucker, often from the lower leaves first. As the plant uses up all its stored water from the tissues, the shriveling will spread to the top of the plant. They will also look dehydrated and feel dry.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Leaves feel flat</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Succulents that are underwatered have flattened, soft leaves. You can feel the leaves and squeeze them. If the leaves feel flat, soft and dry, then they are literally dehydrated and need more water.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Discoloring</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Underwatered plants may also start changing colors. They may darken or begin to yellow. Along with shriveled leaves and discoloration, these are tell-tale signs that it is time to water your plants or to increase frequency and amount of watering.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Overwatered Succulants</strong> </h5>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Wilting and Shriveling</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Overwatered plants look wilted and also shrivel, which may confuse others into thinking they need more water. Usually if the plants look green, the soil is wet, and you know your plant is well-watered, then you are overwatering and not underwatering your plants.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Leaves feel plump</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Feel the leaves to see if they are flat or firm. If you see shriveling but the leaves still feel plump and hard, then the plant is most likely getting too much water.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Brown or yellow leaves</strong></h6>
              <br>
              When the leaves start turning brown or yellow, it is often a sign that something is wrong with the plant. If you notice the leaves of your plants turning brown and yellow, along with wilting and falling leaves, these are often signs that you need to adjust your watering frequecny. If you know your plants are well-watered, they might actually be getting too much water.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Mushy Plants</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Another sign of overwatering is when your plant starts becoming mushy from too much water. The plants have literally absorbed too much water and cannot take in anymore. They blow up and burst and turn into mush.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h6><strong>Root Rot</strong></h6>
              <br>
              Succulents are susceptible to root rot. Root rot occurs when the plant is constantly exposed to too much moisture and the roots begin to decay. Fungal disease sets in and cause the plant to wilt and die. You may notice your plant dropping all of its leaves and looking unwell. If you suspect root rot, remove the plant from the pot and soil and inspect the roots. If the roots appear mushy or slimy and grey or black, root rot may have set in from overwatering.

              <br>
              <h4><strong>Sunlight | Growing Succulants and Cacti Indoors</strong></h4>
              <br>
              <h5>Sunlight</h5>
              <br>
              Succulents and cacti need a certain amount of sunlight to thrive. Plants grow by absorbing  light and turning it into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Providing adequate light, when growing succulents indoors, can be particularly challenging and may need some experimentation on your part. If these plants do not receive adequate light, they do not grow properly. Overtime, succulents that do not receive enough light become weak, distorted and discolored. When not exposed to adequate light they start etoliating or stretching out to look for the sun.
              <br>
              So are succulents and cacti able to thrive inside? Yes. We see proof of this by the numerous succulent species that have become highly adapted to living indoors and have become very popular houseplants. Any succulent species can be kept alive indoors, but this environment may limit the way they typically grow and flourish.
              <br>
              Light, and receiving proper lighting, is one of the most important things to consider when growing your plants, especially indoors. When growing indoors, take into consideration the available  spots and  locations in your house where you can place your plants and consider the type of plant you have, its origin and light requirements to figure out where to best place your plant. Consider the amount of sun and they type of lighting the location receives throughout the day. Ideally, you want to look for a location that will give your plants enough light as well as consistent light. Indoor lighting vary depending on the amount of sunlight you get. Direct natural sunlight coming through a window is not as strong as direct sunlight outside. And the intensity of the light the plants will receive lessens the further you move it away from a window.
              <br>
              <h5>Light Terminology for succulants:</h5>
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Bright</strong> - when we refer to bright light it means there are no curtains, blinds or drapes between the plant and the window. On the other side of the window, there is nothing obstructing the light from coming through the window such as a tree, a shrub or a sign. Bright light means the plant needs to be placed in a sunny location, possibly southern or western facing windows with bright, direct light throughout the day.
              <br>
              <br>
             <strong>Filtered</strong> - filtered light or indirect light means bright light that is not direct, or partially screened and lightly shaded sunlight. Plants that need filtered light need bright sun exposure, preferably a few hours of morning or late afternoon sun. Generally, filtered sunlight means that the plant needs a south or east facing window. Growing your plants in filtered sun will ensure adequate sun exposure without being over exposed to sunlight.
             <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Shady</strong> - or low light means no direct sun or other light. The light that comes through the window is blocked by an outdoor tree, a building or other objects indoors such as curtains or furnitures. Typically, plants that need shady areas also need high humidity.
             <br>
             <br>
             <h4><strong>Soil</strong> </h4>
             <br>
             <h5>Soil Requirments</h5>
             <br>
             Although succulents retain moisture well, they do still need moderate to regular watering, at least once a week or a deep soaking every few weeks during the growing season. But too much water will cause the roots to develop black stem rot, so the trick is finding a growing medium that drains quickly and dries out completely between watering. Succulents do best with soil that is normally considered poor, filled with inorganic elements, as opposed to one rich in organic material.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Organic and Inorganic Elemets</h5>
            <br>
            Despite their need for well-draining soil, succulents do need some nutrients that organic elements provide. Some gardeners recommends a mix of 1 part garden soil, 1 part sand and 1 part peat moss or a mixture of 1 part potting soil and 1 part perlite. Other gardeners avoid potting mixes containing peat, remove any wood and twigs from the mix and add a coarse, gritty type of sand to potting soil.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Testing the soil</h5>
            <br>
            Using sand, pumice, decomposed granite or perlite as the inorganic element in your succulent growing medium is less important than simply ensuring that the soil crumbles easily and lets water flow quickly through. If your soil falls apart after you wet it and give it a squeeze, it has the right components. If it remains formed into a lump, it needs more inorganic elements added to the mix.

              <h4>Planting Succulants and Cacti</h4>
              <br>
              <h5>Potting beauties</h5>
              <br>
              <p>If you’re trying to grow and cultivate your own green thumb, succulents are a great starting point. You won’t find any plants better adapted for growing in pots. Most succulents are native to arid regions and store water in their fleshy leaves, stems, and roots, enabling them to resist drought. This means they do not need to be fussed over with frequent watering, so you can go ahead and enjoy a weeklong summer vacation without giving them a second thought. Plus, their funky shapes and diverse varieties make growing them truly fun. Learn how to make a diverse succulent container arrangement in four easy steps.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Step One</strong></h5>
              <br>
              First, go to the garden center and purchase a variety of succulents in an array colors and shapes. For this container, we purchased 6; depending on the container’s size, you may need more or less (find a list of common succulents on slide 4). You can find the soil, gravel, and container at the garden center as well. When you get back to your home, full the wide, shallow dish three-quarters full with potting mix, and then cover the top with gravel. Succulents don’t need a lot of root space, as they store most of their water and nutrients in their leaves. Gravel helps the soil drain; steer clear of sand, because it can become too compact and lead to root rot.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Step Two</strong> </h5>
              <br>
              Blend the soil and gravel thoroughly, and moisten with water. New plantings should be watered well – but only once. The water will settle the soil. But if you water them too much, you will cause them to die from overwatering. When you give a succulent too much water, it will fill up its water storage tissues to a point of damage. You will know if your succulent is overwatered by its overly puffy-looking stems and leaves, and a general look of unhealthiness. Overwatering leads to root rot, which can kill your succulent. And we are trying to plant live succulents, here.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Step Three</strong></h5>
              <br>
              Remove the plants from their nursery containers, and plant the largest one on one side of the pot. Surround it with the other plants, clustering similar shapes together. Some common succulent types include:
              <br>
              Echeveria – The crown jewels of all rosette-forming  succulents, this type can be found in a variety of colors
              <br>
              Sedum (stonecrop) – These flat-lying succulents are perfect for trailing out from the edge of containers.
              <br>
              Aeonium – Although they come in a variety of colors, we love these fleshy, long-leaved rosettes in lemon yellow
              <br>
              <br>
              <li>These are the most common succulants!</li>
              <br>
              <h5><strong>Step Four</strong></h5>
              <br>
              Sprinkle dark-colored aquarium gravel around each plant so that the soil is covered.
              <br>
              To care for your succulent container garden and prevent root rot, let the soil dry out completely before watering again. Succulents thrive in well-drained soil, but require more water in the early spring when the plant is growing and less during the summer and winter. During the winter, succulents enter a dormant period. You may only need to water your succulents as infrequently as once per month during the winter, and as much as once/week during the springtime growing period (but only when the soil is dry). Keep your succulent container in a place that it is exposed as much sun as possible.
